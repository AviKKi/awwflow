Drag and Drop AI Tool maker

- Setting Modal to set secrets
- Nodes
    - [x] Input
    - [x] Output
    - [x] Prompt AI
    - Text Operations
        - [ ] Merge Text
        - [x] Text Builder (template String)
        - [x] Replace
        - [ ] Split
        - [ ] Chunk
    - Conditional Nodes
        - [ ] A Switch node like blender, to switch the inputs based on some logic
            - [ ] if we reverse logic from 2 to 1, to 1 to 2, we can use this to disable a node
        - [x] A Conditional Parent node, that takes in a boolean and disables the Node execution if bool is false
    - File Reader Node
        - [x] PDF Read
        - [x] TXT Read
    - Code Node
        - [ ] A node to execute custom code
    - Variable Node
        - [x] hardcoded variables like String, List, boolean, number, JSON
        - These are not required as part of input so we can hardcode them in the graph
    - Array Methods
        - [ ] push
        - [ ] concat
        - [ ] getItem
        - [ ] find
        - [ ] map
    - JSON Methods
        - 
    - Tool Node
        - A group of two node, one for feeding tooldefination into the LLM and one for taking tool defination and executing the action
    - [ ] Node management
        - [ ] Group Nodes
        - [ ] Minimize Nodes, minimize nodes into small small squares with just icons and input output labels, like n8n maybe
        - [ ] Re-Route Node inspired from comfyui, one-to-one and one-to-many re-routing logic
        - [ ] Add support for Group and Nested Group, with minimize group option
- NodeJS engine
